## Building

To build the site from the source, ensure you're using the most recent versions of Node and Npm, and pull the latest from master.
Next, run `npm install`, `npm run start` to launch the site in development mode (localhost:1234/index.html) or `npm run build` to build the files in `/dist` directory.
