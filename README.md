Test new project structure with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Building

To build the site from the source, ensure you're using the most recent versions of Node and NPM, and pull the latest from master.
Next, run `npm i`, `npm run start` to launch the site in development mode or `npm run build` to build the files in `/dist` directory.
